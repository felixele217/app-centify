# Centify

This is the codebase of our terminated startup. We meant to solve several problems present in commission management.

## Check it out
1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies (`composer install` & `npm install`)
2. Clone the example.env and enter your database credentials
3. Migrate the database using `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
4. We run our backend with herd; then you spin up the frontend with `npm run dev`
5. Now you can log in with 'product@centify.de' & 'centify' as username and password

To properly check out the app, you would need a pipedrive account, so you can connect to it and load in all your deals. Otherwise, you would not be able to properly see the bulk of the app.
